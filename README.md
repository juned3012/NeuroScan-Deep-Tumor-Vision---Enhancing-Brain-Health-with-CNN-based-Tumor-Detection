# NeuroScan-Deep-Tumor-Vision---Enhancing-Brain-Health-with-CNN-based-Tumor-Detection
• Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture using TensorFlow and Keras for the purpose of detecting brain tumors from medical images.
• Preprocessed a dataset of 2,870 brain tumor images using techniques such as data augmentation, grayscale conversion, and normalization to enhance model performance.
• Implemented a data pipeline utilizing the ImageDataGenerator class to efficiently load and preprocess images, streamlining the training process.
• Achieved an accuracy rate of 93.5% through rigorous model training and optimization, effectively classifying brain tumor images into four distinct categories.
• Utilized the EarlyStopping callback mechanism to prevent overfitting during training, enhancing the model's generalization ability
